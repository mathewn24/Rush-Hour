# Rush-Hour
Sliding block board game implementation in C++ with OOP.

The game is created as follows: 
1. There is a 8x8 grid with at most 10 cars.
2. Each car can be aligned either horizontally or vertically, and can occupy 2 or 3 tiles only.
3. There is an exit hole on the right side of the grid, and the car (Car 0) must reach it to end the game.
4. Each care is defined by its number and car 0, 6, 7 are horizontal cars, and cards 2, 3, 4, 5 are vertical cars.
